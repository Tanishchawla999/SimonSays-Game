#Simon Says game
Built a fun 'Simon Says' game using JavaScript! This project helped me dive deeper into DOM manipulation and event handling. Great hands-on way to reinforce JS fundamentals

How to Play Simon Says :

Start the Game: Press any button to begin.

Watch the Sequence: A color will light up and play a sound.

Repeat the Sequence: Tap the same color.

Level Up: The game adds one more color to the sequence each round.

Remember & Repeat: Keep repeating the entire sequence in the correct order.

Mistake: If you press the wrong color, the game ends with red flash on the screen and prompts you to press any button to restart.
